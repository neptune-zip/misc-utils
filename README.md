# Kyle's Miscellaneous Utility Programs

Hello, if you don't know me idk why you are here, and if you do know me I
probably sent you this repo as a link lol.

## Program List

- Meeting alarm - outlook sucks at reminding me when I have a meeting, so I made
my own alarm that makes it super obvious and filters out all the unimportant
stuff on my calendar because I just manually enter my next important meeting
into this.

- Pomodoro alarm - based upon the logic of the meeting alarm, I just want a
simple pomodoro which will run in the background and motivate me as I study /
work.
